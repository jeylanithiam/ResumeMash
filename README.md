# ResumeMash
ResumeMash: a Flask web app that parses resumes and matches candidates to roles with a swipe-style UI. Built with Python, Flask, SQL, and PDF parsing.

Welcome to ResumeMash, my CS50 final project. It is a web app where candidates can upload their resumes and recruiters have access to a Tinder-style interface where they can either Pass (reject) or Mash (accept) the resumes they see. Over time, an AI model uses those swipes to learn what strong resumes look like in different job fields. Candidates can then come back and see a score and some short feedback on their resume based on how similar resumes have done with recruiters in that specific field.

The app runs on cs50.dev using Flask and SQLite. To get it running, you open the project in the terminal and make sure the needed Python packages are installed: Flask, cs50, PyPDF2 (used to read the PDFs), and scikit-learn (used for the machine learning model). The database file itself, resumemash.db, is created automatically by the code in app.py the first time you run the app; the uploads and models folders are also created if they don’t exist. If you ever want to clear your data and start fresh, you can stop the server, delete resumemash.db, and then run flask run again so the app can recreate an empty database.

When you hit the homepage, you see a short explanation of what ResumeMash does and a dark-themed layout with a navbar at the top. The navbar links change depending on whether you are logged in and what role you have. As a new user, you can either register or log in. When you register, you choose to sign up as a Candidate if you are someone who wants feedback on your resume, or as a Recruiter if you are someone who will be reviewing resumes and swiping on them. After registration, you are logged in automatically and the homepage updates to show actions that match your role.

If you sign up as a candidate, the main thing you do in the app is upload a resume and see AI feedback. From the homepage (or the navbar), you can go to the upload page. There you pick the PDF version of your resume and choose what category or field it should be in (for example software, data, finance, consulting, and so on). When you submit the form, the app saves the PDF on the server, extracts the text from it, and stores both the text and the chosen field in the database so the model can use it when recruiters swipe. If you try to upload exactly the same text for the same field again, the app will detect that and avoid creating a duplicate entry.

After a successful upload, you are redirected to the AI Feedback page. This page shows the field you chose at the top, and if there is a trained model for that field with enough data, it also shows an AI score for your resume as a percentage along with a short explanation of what that score means. The feedback is generated based on which “bucket” your score falls into (high, medium, or low). If there is not yet enough swipe data in your field to train a meaningful model, the page will tell you that instead of showing a score and will explain that more recruiter swipes are needed before feedback can be generated. In all cases, the page also shows your latest uploaded resume embedded as a PDF so you can scroll through it exactly as it appears to recruiters.

If you sign up as a recruiter, you see a different experience. The navbar now shows “Swipe Resumes” instead of upload/feedback. When you click “Swipe Resumes,” you are first prompted to select which category of resumes you want to see (for example finance or software). Once you pick a field, you are taken to a Tinder-style swipe page where you see one resume at a time: the candidate’s name, their target field, and a PDF viewer you can scroll through. At the bottom of the page there are two large buttons: Pass (red) and Mash (green). Every time you press Pass or Mash, the app records that swipe in the database for that specific resume and field. Behind the scenes, both Pass and Mash decisions are used as training labels (0 and 1) for a logistic regression model that scores resumes in that job field. The AI is not retrained on every single swipe; instead, for each field it checks how many swipes exist in that field and retrains the model every time the total count hits a multiple of 10, as long as there are examples of both Pass and Mash. When you reach the end of the randomized list of resumes for that field, you see a “no more resumes to review” page with options to go back home or pick a new field.

To make the app less empty and easier to demo, I also created a helper script that can bulk import a zip file of resumes and create fake candidate accounts for them. If you want to use this, you place a zip file named bulk_resumes.zip in the project directory and then run python bulk_import_resumes.py in the terminal. The script will unzip the PDFs, extract their text, guess candidate names and job fields based on the content and filenames, and insert both users and resumes into the database. This pre-populates the system so the swipe interface has plenty of material even before any real users upload their own resumes.
